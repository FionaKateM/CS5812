**Project context** (What is the discipline and subject of your research?):

## Defining your data/research sources

**2.1 Where will your data/research sources come from?**
*Is it gathered from experiments? From the literature?*
*What instruments? How about observations or photos?*
*[You can delete these prompts when you’re done if you want]*

**2.2 How often will you get new data?**
*Continuously or just from discrete experiments?*
*How many experiments per week?*
*How will this change over time?*

**2.3 How much data/information will you generate?**
*Try to state this in kB/MB/GB*
*How much have you got so far?*
*Try to estimate how this will grow for the rest of the project*

**2.4 What file formats will you use?**
*What software is required to access the data? Are free/open alternatives available?*
*What type of data does each format hold?*

**3.1 How will you structure and name your folders and files?**
*Are there any set or recommended standards in your discipline?*

**3.2 What additional information is required to understand each data file?**
*What would you need to know to reproduce the results from this data?*

**3.3 What different versions of each data file or source will your create?**
*How will you differentiate between different versions, for example do you plan to use files names to denote different versions, e.g. V1, V1.1, V2 etc?*

**4.1  Where will you store your data?**
*Laptop? USB drive? Network storage? In the cloud?*

**4.2 How will your data be backed up?**
*How many copies?*
*Where are they stored?*
*How often are copies updated?*

**4.3 How will you test whether you can restore from your backups?**

**5.1 Who owns the data you generate?**
*Is it you? Your supervisor? The University? An external partner?*

**5.2 Who else has a right to see or use this data?**
*Your supervisor, collaborators, group members?*

**5.3 Who else should reasonably have access to this data when you share it?**
*Readers of your published work? The General Public?*

**5.4 What should/shouldn’t be shared and why?**
*Consider any ethical, legal or commercial restrictions that may affect what you share, how you share it and who you share it with?*

**6.1 What should be archived beyond the end of your project?**
*Everything? Just what you used for your thesis?*
*What might others need/want?*

**6.2 For how long should it be stored?**
*EPSRC guidelines say “10 years from the date of last access”*

**6.3 When will files be moved into the data archive/repository?**
*As you complete the analysis of each file? When you submit your thesis?*

**6.4 Where will the data be stored?**
*Disciplinary repository (e.g. crystallography databases)? X drive? Opus?*

**6.5 Who is responsible for moving data to the data archive and maintaining it?**
*You? Your supervisor? The University?*

**6.6 Who should have access and under what conditions?**
*Are there any embargoes necessary?*

**7.1 Who is responsible for making sure this plan is followed?**
*You may wish to discuss and agree this with your supervisor*

**7.2 How often will this plan be reviewed and updated?**
*You may wish to discuss and agree this with your supervisor*

**7.3 What actions have you identified from the rest of this plan?**
*List them here with timescales*

**7.4 What further information do you need to carry out these actions?**
*Where can you find this information?*
*Who might you be able to ask?*
