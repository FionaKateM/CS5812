Note: This excel sheet is an updated sheet of 'movies_clean' from Github.

Updates done:
- Variables 'Budget' and 'Gross_earnings' have been assigned a unit $.
- Fixed typo on 'Review_by_Crtiics' to 'Review_by_Critics'
- Removed instances/rows that weren't English, Spanish, German and French for Language 


Important Notes:
- I have left the NA. I don't know if this should be imputed or outright deleted, so this needs to be discussed. 
- I haven't converted the currencies
